The functions of the library are:

Servo			- Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Arduino pins. (max. 6 elements)

attach(pin)		- Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin. (only pin 2, 3, 7, 8, 44, and 45)

writeMicroseconds(us)	- Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds. (usable range between 500us and 2500us)

detach()		- Clears the used registers and stops the output of the attached pin. (no pin number needed)
